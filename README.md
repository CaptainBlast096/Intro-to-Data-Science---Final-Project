  This repository contains our project analyzing the video game genre First-Person Shooter (FPS) and comparing it to other genres in video games.
  One of our favorite genres is FPS. We were curious about the populairty of FPS compared to other genres and tested that out by using a Steam dataset
  containing all Steam games up until May 2019.
